This project is the first game I made in Python with the PyGame library.
This game consists of the player (the red square), trying to collect the brown squares.
The player must avoid enemies (purple squares) and can collect powerups (the green and blue squares)
Once the player touches a enemy, the game is over and the score is displayed.
The player can check their score at anytime in the top right corner.
Once the game is over, the user must run the program again to play the game again.
